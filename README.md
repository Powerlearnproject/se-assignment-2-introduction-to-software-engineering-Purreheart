# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
ANS: Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineeering principle,methods and tools to the development and matainance of high quality software sysytems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
ANS: software engineering is the process of designing,developing.testing,deployment and maintainance of software products. software engineering involves feedback from user while traditional prgramming leaves no room for the system to learn or adapt independently

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
ANS:SDLC consist of several phase 
1. Requirement
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintainance
   
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirement: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specification
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirement
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to user for rating and feedback
6. Maintainance: Providing ongoing support,updates, and enhancement to the software afer deployment
   
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
ANS: Agile is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change While waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phase(e.g requiremment,design,implemetation) flowuing downward like a waterfall.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
ANS: Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. 
PROCESS: elicitation, analysis, specification, and verification to ensure software meets stakeholders' needs.
IMPORTANCE: it tells everyone involved with the project what needs to be done

Software Design Principles:
1. Review to minimize errors
2. Assessed for Quality
3. Should Degrade Gently
4. Not suffer from "tunnel vision
5. Should not "Reinvent the wheel

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Testing in Software Engineering:
ANS: Conducting of various tests to ensure the software meet quality standard and functional requirement.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
ANS:
software project manager: oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.
challenges:
Communication. ...
Lack of Accountability. ...
Resource Allocation. ...
Scope Creep. ...
Project Management Software. ...
Poor Planning and Unrealistic Deadlin

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
ANS:Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
1. Preventive Maintenance: Includes regular and time-based schedule
2. Corrective Maintenance: Occurs when an issue is noticed
3. Predictive Maintenance: Is data-driven and impacted by present parameters 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
ANS:
1. Data Security
2. Reliability
3. Transparency
4. Compliance

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ANS:
addictive design;
corporate ownership of personal data;
algorithmic bias;
weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection; and.
overemphasis on features.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
